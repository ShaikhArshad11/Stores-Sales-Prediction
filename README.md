# **Stores-Sales-Prediction**

## Project Name : Stores Sales Prediction.
## Technologies : Machine Learning (Advanced Regression).
## Domain : Sales & Marketing.
---

# **Problem Statement:**
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.
